# Plan Your Travel 

## Travel App
#### Tools used: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Vanilla), Nodejs

### Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. 

### Building
Steps to be followed: 

* Workflow to break project in small steps
* Got my basic project setup and functioning in Visual Studio Code (HTML, installed SASS, wrote styles and set up a local server)
* Installed and configured Webpack (+ essential loaders and plugins)
* Set up async requests to fetch destination image and weather, based on user input, obtained from the submission of form by the user
* Refactored code, installed plugins to minify CSS and run testing with JEST.

## To run the code
- clone the repo - git clone "link".
- Go to travel app folder in command prompt.
- Install node packages- npm i
- npm run build-prod
- npm run build-dev
